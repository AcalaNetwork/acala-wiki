# Acala & Karura Wiki

Welcome to the Acala & Karura wiki, the hub for those interested in learning, building, or using the Acala and Karura protocol. The wiki is divided into sections to cater to each of these different groups in the Acala ecosystem:

1. If you're eager to start building your project to connect to Acala or Karura, see the [build](https://wiki.acala.network/build/) section. 
2. If you're interested in operating a node, head on over to the [maintain](https://wiki.acala.network/maintain/) section. 
3. If you are here to learn, peruse the [learn](https://wiki.acala.network/learn/) section. 
4. If you want to quickly find some general information, such as communities and white papers, please find [general](https://wiki.acala.network/general/).

There are additional two sections one for Karura and one for Acala to outline the specifics of each network.
