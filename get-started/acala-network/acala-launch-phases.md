# Acala Launch Phases

Acala network has a phased launch plan. Keep up-to-date with the roll-out plan by viewing this [live roadmap](https://aca.la/acala-roadmap).

**Current Phase: Win Acala Parachain Slot Auction - Acala Genesis Launch**

## 🚀 (Done) Acala Genesis - Launch

The Genesis block of the Acala network will be launched on 18th December, 2021, as a Proof of Authority network. Governance was restricted to a single super-user (sudo) key, which is held by the Acala Foundation to issue transactions and upgrades to resolve issues and completes the launch process.

Since genesis, Acala's network security is provided by Polkadot's Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) Validators upon launch. Acala's Collators will be provided by node service partners at this stage.

**Acala parachain is available on** [**Subscan**](https://acala.subscan.io) **&** [**Polkadot App**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Facala.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/explorer)**.**
