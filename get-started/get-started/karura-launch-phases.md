# Karura Launch Phases

Karura network has a phased launch plan. Keep up-to-date with the roll-out plan by viewing this [live roadmap](https://aca.la/karura-roadmap).

**Current Phase: Technical Verification & Runtime Upgrade**

## üöÄ (Done) Karura Genesis - Launch

The Genesis block of the Karura network was launched on 23rd June, 2021, as a Proof of Authority network. Governance was restricted to a single super-user (sudo) key, which is held by the Acala Foundation to issue transactions and upgrades to resolve issues and completes the launch process.&#x20;

Since genesis, Karura's network security is provided by Kusama's Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) Validators upon launch. Karura's Collators will be provided by node service partners at this stage.

**Karura parachain is available on** [**Subscan**](https://karura.subscan.io) **&** [**Polkadot App**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkarura.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/explorer)**.**
