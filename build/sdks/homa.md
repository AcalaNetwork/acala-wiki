# Acala Liquid Staking with Homa

To interact with Acala or Karura from Javascript you can use `@polkadot/api` along with `@acala-network/api`. 

We also provide a [Homa SDK](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/acala.js/tree/master/packages/sdk-homa) which can be used to stake DOT or unstake LDOT. 


## Homa Example

Below is an example of how to use the Homa SDK and the polkadot api to stake DOT and unstake LDOT.
