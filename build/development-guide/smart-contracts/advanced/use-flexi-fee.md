# Upcoming Features

### Use Flexi Fee

DOT, aUSD, ACA, RenBTC, AMPL are all first-class fee tokens in Acala EVM, meaning that users can pay transaction fees in any of these tokens. 

Details coming soon. 

### Acala DeFi Contracts

Acala's DeFi primitives \(stablecoin, staking derivative, and DeX\) are being made available as pre-compiled contracts, and will be composable inside Acala EVM.

Details coming soon.

### State Rent

A contract consumes storage on the blockchain, and thus should be charged for simply existing. This ensures that people don't take advantage of "free, unlimited storage". 

This is not a new concept, there're EIP, pre-EIP and discussions to implement state rent in Ethereum. Parity already implements it in the native smart contract platform [Ink!](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/smart-contracts/overview#smart-contracts).

We now introduce this mechanism in Acala EVM. 

Details coming soon.
