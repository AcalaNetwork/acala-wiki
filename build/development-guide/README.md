# Developer Guide

There are 4 ways to build with Acala:&#x20;

1. Deploy permissioned protocol aka _**runtime modules/pallets on the Acala network**_. This is available now with more flexibility for customization & integration. Ren Protocol's Bitcoin bridge gateway is implemented this way. [Read more.](https://wiki.acala.network/build/development-guide/deploy-ecosystem-modules)
2. Deploy permisionless smart contracts using _**Solidity on Acala EVM**_. This is fully composable with aggregated cross-chain liquidity like BTC and DOT, and Acala's existing DeFi stack, and is a landing pad for DApps to access the Polkadot ecosystem. Ampleforth is deployed this way. [Read more.](https://wiki.acala.network/build/development-guide/smart-contracts)
3. Deploy smart contracts using _Ink!_ rust-based native smart contract platform. This is yet to be production-ready and will be made available on Acala later, but if you are interested, feel free to contact us and learn more.&#x20;
4. Build a chain and _**connect with Acala using cross-chain message-passing protocol by Polkadot**_. We are currently deployed on Rococo as a parachain and are testing cross-chain communication, token transfers and other functionalities. If you are also a parachain (or parathread when it's available), and are ready to test cross-chain functionalities, please contact us for options.
