# Build DApps

There are 4 ways to build with Acala:&#x20;

1. ****[**Build Pallet DApp**](deploy-ecosystem-modules.md): deploy permissioned protocol aka _**runtime modules/pallets on the Acala network**_. This is available now with more flexibility for customization & integration. Ren Protocol's Bitcoin bridge gateway is implemented this way.&#x20;
2. [Build Solidity Smart Contract DApp](smart-contracts/): deploy permisionless smart contracts using _**Solidity on Acala EVM**_. This is fully composable with aggregated cross-chain liquidity like BTC and DOT, and Acala's existing DeFi stack, and is a landing pad for DApps to access the Polkadot ecosystem. Ampleforth is deployed this way.&#x20;
3. [Bridge Parachains: ](composable-chains/)build a chain and _**connect with Acala using cross-chain message-passing protocol by Polkadot**_. We are connected to multiple parachains including common-good asset chain Statemine, where assets can be freely bridged to our chain for listing and other integrations. If you are also a parachain and are ready to test cross-chain functionalities, please contact us for options.&#x20;
4. Deploy smart contracts using _Ink!_ rust-based native smart contract platform. This is yet to be production-ready and will be made available on Acala later, but if you are interested, feel free to contact us and learn more.&#x20;

Developers, teams, or organizations looking to integrate the aUSD stablecoin and Acala Network can contact the Acala team here to schedule time to discuss the integration: [https://aca.la/build-with-Acala](https://aca.la/build-with-Acala)
