# Builders Starter's Guide

There are 3 ways to build with Acala

1. Deploy permissioned protocol aka runtime modules/pallets on the Acala network. This is available now with more flexibility for customization & integration.
2. Deploy permisionless smart contracts using ink! or EVM. This is not fully functioning nor production ready yet, but contact us for PoC options.
3. Build a chain and connect with Acala using XCMP. We are waiting for readiness of cross-chain communication, but contact us for PoC options.
