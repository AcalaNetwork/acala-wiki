# Builders Starter's Guide

There are 3 ways to build with Acala: 

1. Deploy permissioned protocol aka runtime modules/pallets on the Acala network. This is available now with more flexibility for customization & integration. [Read more.](https://wiki.acala.network/build/development-guide/deploy-ecosystem-modules)
2. Deploy permisionless smart contracts using ink! or EVM. This is not fully functioning nor production ready yet, but contact us for PoC options. [Read more.](https://wiki.acala.network/build/development-guide/deploy-smart-contracts)
3. Build a chain and connect with Acala using XCMP. We are waiting for readiness of cross-chain communication, but contact us for PoC options. [Read more.](https://wiki.acala.network/build/development-guide/connect-via-xcmp)
