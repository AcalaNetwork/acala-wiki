# On-chain Scheduler

## **On-chain Automatic Scheduler**

On Ethereum and most other EVM platforms, there is no way to automatically schedule a transaction natively. This means many useful and perhaps essential financial services that we take for granted today, such as subscription, are not possible.

On Acala and Substrate, the automatic scheduler is a native feature of the blockchain. It is now made available in the Acala EVM in the form of pre-compiled contracts that any smart contract can call upon.

This will enable a wide range of use cases such as automatic and recurring payment rails, subscription services such as a Web3 version of Stripe, automatic profit-taking, reinvestment mechanisms, and a means to liquidate risky positions without external actors like keepers.
