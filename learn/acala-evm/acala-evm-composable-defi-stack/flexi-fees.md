# Flexible Fees

## **Pay Gas Fees in Virtually Any Token**

With the Acala EVM, fees can be paid in any accepted tokens, such as ACA, aUSD, DOT, and wrapped BTC. More tokens can be supported as native fee tokens with a simple governance approval.

Behind the scenes, Acala DEX is being used as a unified liquidity pool for settling the fees into the network token, but the experience is completely transparent to users and developers.
