# Compatible Toolings

### **Compatible Developer Tooling**

Acala EVM enables developers to develop, test and deploy DApps with existing tooling support, such as [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) and [Waffle](https://getwaffle.io). More toolchains will be added as we progress.

Existing Solidity DApps and node.js applications can communicate with Acala nodes with minimum changes. Developers can use Acalaâ€™s web3 provider [bodhi.js](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/bodhi.js) to interact with an Acala node seamlessly.
