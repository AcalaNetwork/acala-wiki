# Queryable & Lightweight

### **Keep Nodes Lightweight while Queryable**

We retain the standard Substrate node which is lightweight and easily maintainable. For querying transactions and event logs, we offer an indexer node that is open-sourced and anyone can run a copy of it like a full-node.

For convenience, we’d offer one docker image to run both nodes, but it is important that there’s a choice for people who want to run one or another for their purposes.
