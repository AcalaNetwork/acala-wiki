# How does it work?

## The Stack

Project Bodhi is Acalaâ€™s answer to composable EVM compatibility.&#x20;

Instead of emulating the full Ethereum RPC node ([Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier) approach), we emulate the Ethereum JavaScript SDK client experience (by implementing a web3 provider as Bodhi.js).

This initiative has received an Open Grant from Web3 Foundation and is under development. Read more [here](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Open-Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/project\_bodhi.md).
