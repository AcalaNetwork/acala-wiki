# Acala Account

Acala is a Substrate-based blockchain and uses Substrate-based accounts. Users can use one account aka. one private-public keypair on multiple Substrate-based chains. Essentially for one private-public keypair \(one account\) there is a different address representation for different blockchains.

* Generic Substrate addresses start with 5. E.g. the addresses in the Polkadot{js} extension
* You can check your address representation on different blockchain [here](https://acala-testnet.subscan.io/tools/ss58_transform)

The address format used in Substrate-based chains is SS58. SS58 is a modification of Base-58-check from Bitcoin with some minor modifications. Find out more on the Substrate address format [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-accounts).
