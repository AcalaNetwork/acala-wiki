# Flexi Fees

### **Flexi Transaction Fees**

On Acala, fees can be paid in any accepted tokens e.g. ACA, aUSD, DOT, BTC etc. More tokens can be supported as native fee tokens with governance approval.

Behind the scene, Acala DeX is being used as a unified liquidity pool for settling the fees into the network token, but the experience is completely transparent to users and developers.
