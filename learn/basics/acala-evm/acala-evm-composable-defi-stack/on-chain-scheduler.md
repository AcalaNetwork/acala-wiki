# On-chain Scheduler

### **On-chain Automatic Scheduler**

On Ethereum and most other EVM platforms, there is no way to automatically schedule a transaction natively, for example, a subscription payment DApp would not be possible. 

On Acala Network and Substrate for that matter, automatic scheduler is a native feature of the blockchain, and it is also a native feature in Acala EVM that any smart contract DApps can call.
