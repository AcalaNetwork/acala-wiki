# On-chain Scheduler

### **On-chain Automatic Scheduler**

On Ethereum and most other EVM platforms, there is no way to automatically schedule a transaction natively. This means many useful and perhaps essential financial services that we enjou take for granted today, such as subscription, is not possible. 

On Acala Network and Substrate for that matter, the automatic scheduler is a native feature of the blockchain. It is now made available in the Acala EVM in the form of pre-compiled contracts that any smart contracts can call upon.

This will enable a wide range of use cases such as automatic and recurring payment rails, subscription services e.g. a Web3 version of Stripe, automatic take profit, reinvest, and liquidate risky positions without external actors like keepers. 

Details of the auto-scheduler contract [here](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/predeploy-contracts/blob/master/README.md#on-chain-automatic-scheduler).
