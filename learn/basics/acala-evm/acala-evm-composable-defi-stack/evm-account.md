# EVM Account

## **Single Wallet, Single Account Experience**

Users can use **one extension/wallet**, and **a single Substrate account** to interact with the Substrate runtime, contracts in EVM, and wasm contracts or a hybrid of these. If a user wants to use a particular Ethereum address, then simply link it with his/her Substrate address \(basically proving the user owns both addresses\), thereafter the user can just use the Substrate account with [Polkadot{js} extension](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-account-generation) or alike to sign any Ehtereum transactions seamlessly.

This allows users to use all functionalities within Acala and cross-chain capabilities without managing multiple accounts or wallets.
