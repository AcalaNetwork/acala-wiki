# Single Account

### **Single Wallet, Single Account Experience**

Users can use **one extension/wallet**, and **a single Substrate account** to interact with the Substrate runtime, contracts in EVM, and wasm contracts or a hybrid of these. If a user wants to use a particular Ethereum address, then simply link it with his/her Substrate address \(basically proving the user owns both addresses\), thereafter the user can just use the Substrate account to sign any Ehtereum transactions seamlessly.

This allows users to use all functionalities within Acala and cross-chain capabilities without managing multiple accounts or wallets.
