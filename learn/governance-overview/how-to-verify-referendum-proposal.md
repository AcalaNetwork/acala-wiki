# How to Verify Referendum Proposal

Navigate to [Polkadot JS App](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) - select intended network e.g. Acala or Karura, then select `Developer` - `Extrinsics`

Click on the `Decode` tab on top of the page.

Put the hex-encoded proposal in the `hex-ecoded-call` input box.

The content of the proposal shall automatically displayed on the page to be verified.

At the bottom of the page, the `encoded call hash` shall be checked against the actual proposal on-chain.
