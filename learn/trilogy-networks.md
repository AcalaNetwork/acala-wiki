# Trilogy Networks

The evolution of the Acala is marked by trilogy networks. Acala stablecoin protocol, Acalaswap protocol and Homa staking protocol are deployed on all three networks:

* **#1 Mandala Test Network**: is a risk-free and value-free playground for us, users and developers to test drive functionalities of Acala. Expect bugs, chaos, and unannounced reboots. Find out Mandala Testnet details [here](broken-reference).
* **#2 Karura Network**: is an unaudited and experimental release of Acala protocols on the Kusama network as a parachain. It will have economic value represented as its native tokens KAR, and KSM, both of which can be used as reserve assets of the stablecoin. Find out Karura Network details [here](../karura/home.md).
* **#3 Acala Network**: will be deployed on the Polkadot network as parachain upon its launch.
