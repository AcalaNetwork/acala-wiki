# Trilogy Networks

The evolution of the Acala Network will be marked by trilogy networks:

* **\#1 Mandala Test Network**: is a risk-free and value-free playground for us, users and developers to test drive functionalities of Acala. Expect bugs, chaos, and unannounced reboots.
* **\#2 Karura Network**: is an unaudited and experimental release of Acala that will join the Kusama network as parachain. It will have economic value represented as its native tokens, and KSM can be used as collateral for kaUSD.
* **\#3 Acala Mainnet**: will be connected to the Polkadot network upon its launch.
