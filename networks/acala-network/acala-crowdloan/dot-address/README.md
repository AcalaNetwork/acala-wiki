# DOT Address

If you are not participating through an Exchange, you will need to create a DOT address to participate in the Acala crowdloan. This DOT address also has a corresponding Acala (ACA) address that shares the same public-private-keypair, which will be used to receive your ACA rewards.

If you don't have any account set up, we will show you how to create a new DOT account in this guide.
