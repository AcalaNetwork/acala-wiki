## 2. Crowdloan Overview

The crowdloan event is an important milestone for launching the Acala network.

### 2.1 Parachain Auction

Polkadot is a sharded, multi-chain network that allows blockchains to connect for interoperability, scalability, and plug-and-play network security. To join Polkadot’s network, all parachains must participate in and win a unpermissioned candle auction to secure a slot on the network. Parachains can choose to raise DOT in a variety of ways in order to participate in the auction.

### 2.2 Purpose of Acala Crowdloan&#x20;

Acala has chosen to host a Crowdloan to trustlessly crowdsource DOT, which will be used to participate in the Polkadot parachain auction. These DOT will be bonded, or ‘locked’, in the Polkadot Relay Chain for the duration of Acala’s parachain lease.

**Crowdsourced Network Security**&#x20;

DOT holders lock their tokens on Polkadot for a period of time (2 years for the first parachain auction) to help Acala lease a parachain slot and gain access to Polkadot’s plug-and-play security. In return for DOT holders’ loan, ACA (Acala’s native token) will be distributed to participants.

**Community-backed Launch**&#x20;

DOT tokens will be returned to holders following parachain lease, with a guarantee of receiving the DOT principal back. It can be seen as a community-backed launch for individuals looking to contribute to the evolution of Polkadot’s network and parachains.

**Fair Network Bootstrapping**&#x20;

The ACA distributed to participants will be vested over a period of time, but the full balance can be used to participate in governance and other activities besides transferring. This helps us to build a strong and well-intentioned community from the ground up.
