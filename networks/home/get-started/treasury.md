## What is Karura Treasury

Karura Treasury experiments with similar concepts and mechanisms of the Acala Treasury. Watch [the Acala Treasury intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8g89OPFH8) to learn more.

The Karura Treasury is a reserve of digital tokens, native and foreign to the Acala ecosystem, governed by KAR holders and funded from Karura’s protocol fees and community contribution events with the purpose of enabling long-term network self-sustainability and growth.

Deployment of the Treasury is initiated via Karura Treasury Proposals \(KTP\) that could include, but are not limited to:

* Self-funding a parachain slots on Kusama
* Bootstrapping protocol liquidity \(e.g. provide LKSM, kUSD or DEX pair liquidity\)
* Platform and protocol operations and improvements
* Network security operations and enhancements
* Software and tool development
* Community, marketing, and event funding
* Any other future community Karura Treasury Proposals \(KTPs\)

## Existential Goal

The primary objective of the Karura Treasury is to build up its KSM reserve to ensure Karura has a sustainable reservoir of KSM to lease a parachain slot from Kusama for the foreseeable future. The Treasury can trustlessly deploy the tokens to bond a parachain for itself to sustain its operation, bootstrap liquidity of the DeFi protocols on Karura to solve the chick-and-egg problem of market makers and takers hence benefiting the entire network, and support continuous platform and ecosystem development. This experiment may demonstrate positive reinforcement that will trickle up Karura’s network security, sustainability and network utility.
