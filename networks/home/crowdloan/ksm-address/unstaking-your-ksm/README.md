# Unstaking Your KSM

In preparation for the Karura [crowdloan event](../../), supporters who are currently staking (bonding) their KSM will need to unstake prior to bonding their KSM to the crowdloan module. For recently unstaked KSM tokens, Kusama has a delayed exit period (7 days), which serves as cooldown.&#x20;

The following guides are available:&#x20;
