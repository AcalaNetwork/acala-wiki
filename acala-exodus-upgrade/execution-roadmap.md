The Sinai Upgrade is the next major phase of Acala’s technological advancement, following the successful completion of the Exodus upgrade. This section outlines the objectives and key features of the Sinai Upgrade.

#### One-Click MultiChain Cross-stack DeFi

This innovative feature streamlines the process of interacting with multiple blockchain ecosystems through a single, user-friendly interface. By enabling seamless cross-chain transactions, Acala aims to significantly reduce the complexity and improve the efficiency of accessing diverse DeFi products across different blockchains. Acala has taken user experience as a top priority when building new products.&#x20;

#### Ethereum, Solana & L2 chain Liquidity Integration

Acala Network will expand its interoperability by integrating liquidity from Ethereum, Solana, and various Layer 2 (L2) chains. This upcoming enhancement will allow for smoother asset transfers and greater access to a diverse range of decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities across these leading blockchain networks. Read more about the liquidity integration in this [article](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/the-new-frontier-of-restaking-and-yield-bearing-lp-pools-on-acala-4cd4ac23e9b7).&#x20;

#### LSTFi Ecosystem Expansion

Acala Network  is set to broaden its DeFi landscape focusing on the enhancement and diversification of Liquid Staking Token Finance (LSTFi). This initiative will introduce new products and partnerships that leverage the benefits of liquid staking tokens, offering users more flexibility and yield-generating opportunities. As part of this expansion, the platform will integrate additional staking options and financial instruments designed to optimize liquidity and yield. This strategic development of native and non-native products will not only enrich our current offerings but also attract a wider audience, establishing a more robust and versatile DeFi ecosystem.

#### Euphrates Goes Multichain

The [Euphrates platform](https://farm.acala.network/), known for its boosted liquid staking capabilities, will extend its reach across multiple popular blockchain networks. This strategic enhancement aims to funnel liquidity into various applications across different chains, thereby maximizing user rewards and broadening investment opportunities. By integrating with multiple chains, Euphrates will enhance its ability to attract diverse pools of liquidity. This expansion supports a seamless and efficient interaction for users, reinforcing Euphrates’ position as a leader in innovative staking solutions.

#### Open Gov Upgrade

The Open Gov Upgrade marks a transformative step in enhancing our on-chain governance system by adopting a model used within the Polkadot ecosystem. This change will better democratize decision-making processes, allowing for more transparent and community-driven governance. ACA holders will be able to propose, vote on, and implement changes directly within the ecosystem, ensuring that the platform remains responsive to the needs and preferences of its community. The upgrade will introduce mechanisms for greater participation and accountability, fostering a more inclusive and adaptable governance framework.

#### Cross Chain Security Enhancement

Recognizing the critical importance of robust security in a multichain landscape, we are committed to enhancing protective measures across blockchain networks. To this end, we have introduced Sentinel, an open-source tool that currently offers essential functionalities like rate limiting between parachains to maintain network stability and prevent misuse. As we continue to expand our multichain capabilities, Sentinel will evolve to include more advanced security features. These enhancements will fortify our cross-chain security framework, providing comprehensive protection against a broader spectrum of vulnerabilities and attacks, ensuring a safer and more reliable blockchain environment for all users.

#### Performance Upgrade: Asynchronous Backing

The Acala network is set to undergo a significant performance upgrade through the implementation of asynchronous backing. This advanced feature is designed to enhance the network's throughput and efficiency by allowing transactions to be processed in a non-linear, asynchronous manner. This upgrade is critical for supporting higher transaction volumes and providing a smoother, faster user experience, aligning with Acala’s commitment to scalable and robust blockchain solutions.

#### JAM Service Research & Development

The Acala team is actively involved in the research and development of the newly introduced Polkadot JAM chain. By leveraging our expertise in development in blockchain technology, we aim to enhance and refine the functionalities of this cutting-edge chain. This initiative allows us to advance decentralized technologies and further cement our leadership in the blockchain industry.

#### aSEED II: Vault Conversion

We are developing a conversion pallet designed to allow a percentage of the collateral in a vault to be transferred to the aSEED treasury, while the remaining collateral is returned to the vault owner. Additionally, this conversion can be scheduled to execute at a future date, providing vault owners ample time to prepare for the changes.

#### aSEED III: Redemption

We are preparing to implement a redemption mechanism for aSEED by drafting proposals and establishing voting protocols for redemption criteria, such as eligibility after 12 months with the underlying aSEED value being at least $1. The delivery of the redemption pallet code will enable the redemption of aSEED using treasury assets, allowing users to exit their aSEED positions.
