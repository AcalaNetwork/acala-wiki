# Unstaking Your KSM Tokens on Polkawallet

You will need to unstake your KSM tokens prior to bonding them to the crowdloan module. For recently unstaked KSM tokens, Kusama has a delayed exit period (7 days), which serves as cooldown. During this period, you will not be able to transfer your tokens.\
