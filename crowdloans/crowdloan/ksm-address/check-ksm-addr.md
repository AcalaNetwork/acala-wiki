# Check KSM Address

If you already set up a Polkadot account, Acala account, or any Substrate-based chain account, there are three options to check the corresponding KSM address:

* [Subscan Address Transform](https://acala-testnet.subscan.io/tools/ss58\_transform)
* toggle your wallets in polkadot.js extension&#x20;
* toggle your wallet in Polkawallet mobile app

## Using Subscan transform

1. Navigate to [Subscan Address Transform](https://acala-testnet.subscan.io/tools/ss58\_transform) and paste your existing account address into "Input Account or Public Key".
