# Acala Hackathon Guide

## Start Here

* **Join** [**Acala Official Discord**](https://discord.gg/vdbFVCH) ****to explore DeFi on Polkadot, for product and technical questions
* [**Watch**](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/acala-ethdenver-2021) the webinar: **Deploying your Ethereum Project on Polkadot & Acala**

## Resources

### What is Polkadot

Polkadot is a sharded, multichain network founded by Dr. Gavin Wood, the co-founder and CTO of Ethereum, creator of EVM and Solidity programming language. Polkadot is a metaprotocol that is highly scalable and cross-chain interoperable; chains connected to Polkadot like Acala would share Polkadot's PoS network security from day one of launch.

### What is Acala

Acala is a cross-chain DeFi Hub and de facto stablecoin platform for Polkadot. It’s also a landing pad for Ethereum DeFi Dapps to get access to the Polkadot ecosystem and aggregated cross-chain liquidity like BTC. In terms of core offerings, Acala provides a set of DeFi products and primitives: multi-collateralized stablecoin using Bitcoin, DOT & other assets, a staking derivative Liquid DOT \(LDOT\) allowing users to stake while participating in other yield earning DeFi activities at the same time, and also a DeX that provides cross-chain unified liquidity.

### Acala EVM

Acala is also the gateway for Ethereum Apps to get access to the Polkadot ecosystem, making cross-chain liquidity and protocols composable. Acala EVM is one module on the Acala Network. Acala EVM enables Solidity contracts to be deployed on Acala/Polkadot with minimum changes. It also offers many distinct features such as paying fees in any tokens like stablecoin, and there’s an on-chain automatic scheduler that enables use cases like subscription and recurring payments etc.
