# Build Acala \| June 2021

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*cqbuCb31-LyqTzMX)

After months of building and educating our community on the novel framework for parachain auctions and crowdloans, our team ended June 2021 in celebration, as Karura officially secured the first public parachain slot on Kusama!

The achievement was no small feat, as Kusama required competing teams to bid KSM in a parachain slot auction to secure their connection to its relay chain. With over 500,000 KSM contributed by the community — over $100 million USD in total value locked — Karura has won the first-ever parachain slot auction on Kusama and has launched its scalable, EMV-compatible network optimized for DeFi.

### **Karura wins with community-contribution of 501k KSM** <a id="1919"></a>

With our community leading the charge, Karura received 501k KSM from over 20,000 individuals across the world. 86.8% came from non-custodial accounts, and 13.2% of the contributions came from exchanges. Over 75% of contributions were 10 KSM or less, showing a very large distribution among smaller holders. All in all, it was a huge milestone for the Karura and Acala team that showed a substantial demand for our DeFi platform and products in the Kusama and Polkadot Ecosystem.

### **Karura’s launch process has begun** <a id="f3df"></a>

Karura winning the parachain slot auction is only step one of many. We have since rapidly moved into the launch phases, most recently KAR distribution. Karura will be moving quickly, yet safely, through this launch plan hosted on Notion. [Please bookmark this launch tracker](https://www.notion.so/acala/dcabf9ba7c6246c69b913d5972503227?v=4121894373fd43d98ffcac260803928d) if you’d like to track the ongoing progress. Our next major steps will be to enable KSM transfers from Kusama to Karura, enable KAR transfers, enable the Karura DEX, and enable the Karura Dollar kUSD stablecoin.

The Karura team also hosted an online event where we went into detail on the launch process, how to find KAR distributions from the crowdloan, new wiki updates, and other launch details. You can watch the recording here:
