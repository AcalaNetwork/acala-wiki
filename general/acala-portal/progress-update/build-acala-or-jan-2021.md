# Build Acala | Jan 2021

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/0\*AKMAckfj4PDxBHMX)

Well, 2021 has wasted no time continuing the drama of late. Elon Musk is supporting Bitcoin (and shilling Doge), Ray Dalio wrote a piece on Bitcoin and digital assets, and Mark Cuban wrote a long blog discussing DeFi, crypto, and NFTs. Oh and a subreddit community has created a short squeeze among some of the top hedge funds in the United States. Where will this lead? Only time will tell, but it’s surely a positive indicator of a world moving toward decentralized technologies and democratized financial systems.

After a brief holiday around the new year, we’ve spent January working on several initiatives: Acala has launched a parachain on Polkadot’s testnet Rococo, we’ve significantly grown our community across Acala and Karura, three new people have joined the Acala team, the Acala Dollar is being integrated with Injective, Bette spoke at Binance Blockchain Week, and we are preparing for our time with developers at ETHDenver.

If you’re new to Acala, welcome! [Acala](http://acala.network) is the decentralized financial hub of Polkadot that provides financial applications and stable assets to DeFi users.

### **Acala on Polkadot’s Parachain Testnet, Rococo** <a href="08f9" id="08f9"></a>

Acala Mandala PC2 (Acala’s parachain candidate) was the first parachain connected to Rococo, Polkadot’s parachain testnet. You can check all the connected parachains [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frococo-rpc.polkadot.io#/parachains).

Anyone can check out Acala Mandala PC2 [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frococo-1.acala.laminar.one%2Fws#/explorer).

We are currently doing internal testing with the parachain and will open it up to public to use and test in the very near future so people can try cross-chain interactions themselves.

### **Acala Dollar Integration Coming to Injective Protocol** <a href="d3b3" id="d3b3"></a>

Acala and Injective are working together to integrate the Acala Dollar (aUSD) into Injective’s derivative trading ecosystem. The integration of aUSD will provide a stable asset that can be used to collateralize Polkadot-based derivative products on Injective. This also expands opportunities for us to create new derivative products alongside Injective, further increasing the use cases for aUSD. More here:
