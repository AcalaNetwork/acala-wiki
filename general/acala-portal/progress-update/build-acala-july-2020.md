## Ecosystem Update <a href="#068a" id="068a"></a>

**PolkaDeFi Day community conference**, 18 June: we co-hosted the first-ever Polkadot community conference dubbed PolkaDeFi Day. **Over 1,500+ developers, community members and enthusiasts joined** the event via Crowdcast and bilibili in China. It featured state-of-art technologies in cross-chain communication and governance, as well as a lively DeFi community.

The event showed the world there is plenty to get very excited about in DeFi: Acala leading the charge as the DeFi hub, Laminar using aUSD for synthetics and margin trading Forex and other asset classes, Interlay and ChainX providing cross-chain Bitcoin facilities, Centrifuge offering tokenized off-chain assets, Chainlink enabling oracle price feeds, and Plasm supercharging layer-two applications. You can watch the replay and join the community [here](https://polkadefi.acala.network).

**New ecosystem collaborators:** We are delighted to have [Chorus One](https://chorus.one), a prominent staking infrastructure provider, and [Ryabina](https://ryabina.io), a Polkadot validator and active community member join our ecosystem program. Chorus One has led a liquid staking research group and recently published [an industry report ](https://blog.chorus.one/liquid-staking-report/)where it featured Acala’s trustless staking derivative Homa protocol. We are also working with a popular bridge to deploy on the Acala network and bring inter-chain liquidity to the Polkadot ecosystem. We’ll be able to share more details soon so stay tuned!

**Mandala (Acala’s Test Network) Festival Season #3:** we are co-hosting the campaign with Laminar around mid-July, and calling on participants to not only swap to stake and get staking derivatives (LDOT), then collateralize LDOT for stablecoin, but to also **cross over to Laminar Chain to margin trade synthetics such as forex and gold using aUSD**. During the campaign, we will simulate Black Thursday volatility and exercise the emergency shutdown drill. Stay tuned for updates!

## Development Update <a href="#3e4a" id="3e4a"></a>

**Acala Test Network Mandala TC4** will be launched with the following improvements:

* **Flexible fees: transaction fees are payable in any supported tokens,** for example when transacting aUSD fees are payable in aUSD. This will be a subtle yet huge enhancement for UX.
* We have upgraded to use [the weight system for transaction fee](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-transaction-fees) estimation, although it’s still work-in-progress to benchmark all modules, **our oracle infrastructure can support free (or low fee but safe) price feed transactions** with **prioritized processing** similar to Quality of Service. This is a significant enhancement that will effectively avoid oracle being stuck due to network congestion that happened on [Black Thursday](https://defipulse.com/blog/defi-status-report-black-thursday/). Find out more on our oracle implementation, see details [here](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/d804a14101909adcc7d1a563bcf30807cb0f4650/oracle).
* Coming out of the [IDEO CoLab Product Validation Day](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/acala-joining-product-validation-day-with-ideo-colab-ventures-3735f9592cf6), we have further **enhanced the UX of our web application** — a smoother flow for the stablecoin product, and a drastically simplified instant and liquid staking process i.e. swap DOT to LDOT (the fungible staking derivative) for staking.
