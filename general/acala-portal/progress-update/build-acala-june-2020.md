# Build Acala \| June 2020

By [Acala Network](https://medium.com/u/43f74518f3f4?source=post_page-----6de2a967e588----------------------)

Our New Zealand team has returned to the office as the country easing lockdown restrictions. May has been a fruitful month, with highly anticipated Polkadot launch, Acala completing stablecoin development milestone, and a rather successful testnet campaign with overwhelming community participation and support.

## Ecosystem Update <a id="983b"></a>

**Polkadot launch**, 26 May: A sharded blockchain protocol, Polkadot was initiated by the Web3 Foundation. Acala, an ecosystem project highlighted [in the Polkadotâ€™s launch article](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/w3f-initiates-launch-polkadot-is-live-8f2310d113a7), is preparing to launch on both the canary Kusama network and Polkadot in the next few months as the Cross-Chain Message Passing \(XCMP\) communication facility is ready.

**New ecosystem projects:** We are delighted to have [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/), a blockchain cloud infrastructure provider supported by Binance, [Figment Network](https://figment.network/), Canadaâ€™s top blockchain infrastructure and staking provider, and [Subscan](https://acala-testnet.subscan.io/), a multi-chain block explorer for Substrate-based blockchains, joining our Ecosystem Program as collaborators.

**Mandala \(Acalaâ€™s Test Network\) Festival Season \#2:** A campaign that rewards crypto enthusiasts, end-users, node runners, bloggers and developers. We have received overwhelming community participation and support. At its peak, the network had 1400+ nodes running from 43 different cities \(Acala has the most nodes online than any Substrate chain\), nearly 2,000 new accounts, 40,000+ meaningful transactions, totally given out 10,000+ ACA and 700,000 KAR.

## Development Update <a id="ca97"></a>

**Acala has completed all milestones for the Web3 Foundation grant, which include:**

1. **A delightful DApp** \(mobile and web\) experience to a self-service credit facility of cross-chain assets such as bitcoin for the stablecoin, Acala Dollar \(aUSD\)
2. **A set of risk management mechanisms** with more automation, efficiency, liquidity, capitalization and ultimately enhanced stability for the stablecoin system
3. **On-chain governance** with progressive decentralization and economic sovereignty via decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund \(dSWF\)

**An emergency shutdown drill** is planned to relive the Black Thursday price collapse, and our community will be rewarded to participate in the liquidation process and test Acalaâ€™s advanced liquidation mechanisms.
