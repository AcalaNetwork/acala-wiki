# Build Acala | Aug 2020

July has been a month of buidling with ecosystem collaborators like [Ren](https://renproject.io) and [Laminar](http://laminar.one), stress testing the network with tens of thousands of new accounts and transactions throughout the Mandala Festival Season #3 testnet campaign, and getting ready to launch on Polkadot‚Äôs parachain testnet Rococo.

## **Development Update** <a href="be77" id="be77"></a>

* **Polkadot‚Äôs parachain testnet **[**Rococo: **was launched](https://polkadot.network/introducing-rococo-polkadots-parachain-testnet/) earlier this week, a significant step towards cross-chain integration. Parachains can now connect to the Relay chain to use its shared security, and the much-anticipated cross-chain message passing is also available, though limited to horizontal message passing where the Relay chain will be used to route messages between two parachains. Acala is working towards registering on Rococo to test out the functionalities.
* [**RenVM-bridge module**](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala/tree/master/ecosystem-modules)** & renBTC integration:** was deployed on Acala Mandala testnet TC4, marking the first step bringing renBTC to Acala and the Polkadot ecosystem. renBTC is now a fee token, can be used as collateral for stablecoin credit line, and is listed on Acala DeX.
* **Substrate RC4**: Mandala TC4 is now upgraded to [Substrate RC4](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc4), which allows atomic transactions ‚Äî one step closer to production-ready smart contracts, and will soon be upgraded to the latest TC5 upon testnet campaign conclusion.
* **Acala Pulse**: an analytics dashboard to track stats of the network is under construction and will be released in the coming week. Users can track system fundamentals ‚Äî aUSD issuance, DeX volume, and DOT amount in liquid staking, as well as system risks, liquidations and auctions, etc.
* **Black Thursday drill & Emergency Shutdown**: next week, [as part of the Mandala Festival](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala/wiki/W.-Contribution-&-Rewards#week-3-black-thursday-simulation), we will simulate Black Thursday volatility, test the hybrid liquidation mechanism that involves DeX and auctions to efficiently recover the loans. Then we will enact the system Emergency Shutdown, process all outstanding loans, and have users reclaim their collaterals from a basket of assets. _Festival week 3 rules & rewards are _[_here_](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala/wiki/W.-Contribution-&-Rewards#week-3-black-thursday-simulation)_._
