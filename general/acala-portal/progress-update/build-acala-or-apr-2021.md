# Build Acala \| Apr 2021

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

April was a month highlighted by a few key events that will help shape the direction of both Acala and Karura’s networks — most notably our grant from Compound Grants, our integration with Chainlink oracles, and our partnership with Gauntlet. We also completed our first Build Acala event, which was a community-oriented event to begin bootstrapping the Acala Treasury. Last, our team was out in the cryptosphere talking about Acala, Karura, Polkadot, Kusama, crowdloans, and more, so check out those videos below.

### **Acala Receives Compound Grant for Starport**

Acala has received one of the first Compound Grants for our proposal to integrate with Compound Chain and implement its cross-chain interface, Starport. \([Tweet link](https://twitter.com/compoundgrants/status/1377653213990682629?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1377653213990682629%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Dd04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87cschema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fcompoundgrants%2Fstatus%2F1377653213990682629image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3D4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd)\)

One of the leading DeFi teams first built on Ethereum, Compound has recently launched the Compound Gateway testnet — an independent cross-chain money market blockchain built with Substrate.

Acala’s Starport project will enable us to bring Compound’s services and CASH token \(Compound’s interest-bearing token\) to Acala and Polkadot, and introduce DOT and Liquid DOT \(LDOT\) as new collateral assets to the Compound money market. Read more in the full blog post:

### **Build Acala Event**

In April, Acala hosted the first Build Acala event to begin bootstrapping the Acala Treasury. Although participation in Build Acala was limited, we are very happy to have been able to involve so many of you. For those who were unable to participate, please note that any registrants with a verified status will have a chance to participate in future events, and additionally, any registrants with an incomplete status will have a chance to complete KYC and verification at a later date. [Sign up for the **Acala newsletter** ](https://money.usnews.com/investing/cryptocurrency/slideshows/whats-the-best-cryptocurrency-to-buy?slide=8) to be kept in the loop about future events.

### **Acala & Karura Media**

[ **Dan Reecer** ](https://twitter.com/danreecer_) discussed the crowdloan and parachain auction process for Kusama and Polkadot at the Blockdown conference:

### **Karura + Chainlink Integration**

[Karura](https://acala.network/karura) has integrated [Chainlink Price Feeds](https://data.chain.link/). Chainlink’s decentralized price oracles provide Karura smart contract developers with tamper-proof, hyper-reliable, and precise financial market data directly on-chain. Developers can use that data to quickly start building secure DeFi applications and products across numerous use cases like derivatives, lending, stablecoins, asset management, and more.

This integration was made possible by the recent launch of a [Chainlink oracle pallet](https://polkadot.network/chainlink-makes-oracle-pallet-available-to-all-substrate-polkadot-and-kusama-chains-2/), which gives all projects within the Polkadot ecosystem, including parachains, substrate chains, and Kusama parachains like Karura, a standardized way to natively integrate Chainlink oracles. With Chainlink Price Feeds already pre-made, resistant to manipulation \(e.g. to protect against flash loan attacks\), and actively securing billions of dollars in value across DeFi, we believe Karura developers will greatly benefit from integrating them as their go-to price oracle solution.

### **Gauntlet Partners with Acala & Karura**

**Acala** and **Karura** have entered into a strategic partnership with [ **Gauntlet** ](http://gauntlet.network/). Gearing up for Acala’s Kusama-based launch of [Karura](http://acala.network/karura), Gauntlet will build a financial model for Karura with a focus on market risks like solvency and capital efficiency. This model will also be refined and extended for Acala on the Polkadot at launch.

**Gauntlet** is a simulation platform for on-chain risk management. Gauntlet has performed market risk assessments for [Compound](https://gauntlet.network/reports/compound), [MakerDAO](https://maker-report.gauntlet.network/), [Liquity](https://liquity-report.gauntlet.network/), [Notional](https://notional-report.gauntlet.network/), [Aave](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gauntlet.network/reports/aave&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1620757829310000&usg=AOvVaw3y5W7MBStjIx2EO6Nq44UL), and more. They are active participants in numerous communities and governance processes — including Uniswap and Compound where they are top delegates. Gauntlet’s [risk scores](https://risk.gauntlet.network/) can be found on DeFi Pulse where they provide Economic Safety Grades for lending protocols. Most recently, Gauntlet has partnered with [Balancer](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/balancer-v2-pools-trading-fee-methodology-7a65df671b8c) to dynamically set pool trading fees to maximize the returns of liquidity providers.

### **Karura Product Demos**

In April, [Ruitao Su](https://twitter.com/ruitao_su) and Dan Reecer held a webinar to demonstrate Karura’s three core products: the Karura DEX, kUSD stablecoin loans, and Liquid KSM \(LKSM\) staking. Check out the clips of the product demos below!

_**Perform swaps with the Karura DEX:**_  [https://youtu.be/UzhsgA0l0qU](https://youtu.be/UzhsgA0l0qU) 

_**Borrow kUSD on Karura:**_  [https://youtu.be/CYpKIFvwrpA](https://youtu.be/CYpKIFvwrpA)

### **Learn how Crowdloans and Parachain Auctions work**

Kusama crowdloans and parachain auctions are rapidly approaching. Make sure you’re up to speed on how the process works, and stay tuned for more educational videos on the details of how to participate in the Karura crowdloan. [https://youtu.be/TQ87jBOe4Tk](https://youtu.be/TQ87jBOe4Tk) 

Have a great month of May! Until next time,
