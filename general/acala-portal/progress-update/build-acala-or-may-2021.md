It’s full steam ahead for Acala and Karura, as we’re now days away from the [Kurura Crowdloan](https://acala.network/karura/join-karura) and [Kusama Parachain Auctions](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/countdown-to-karura-a-deep-dive-on-the-defi-hub-of-kusama-410066fc1e1f), two key events that pave the way for Karura’s launch as the first parachain on Kusama.

With Karura in view, the team has been hard at work growing the Acala ecosystem while establishing new collaborations — most notably a first-of-its-kind [partnership with Current.com](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/current-and-acala-announce-partnership-bringing-hybrid-finance-hyfi-to-currents-3-million-u-s-d16623ce40e9) to deliver a hybrid finance (HyFi) integration to the banking platform’s 3 Million U.S. customers. The announcement was made at Polkadot Decoded during Acala co-founder Bette Chen’s presentation “[Composing Next-Gen DApps with DeFi Legos on Acala](https://youtu.be/A28HOaewbDo?list=PLOyWqupZ-WGuAB8z\_PkZD6f-IA6CUONFb),” and is exemplary of Acala’s mission to support and nurture open finance with stability, liquidity, and accessibility for all.

In step with these goals, Acala is pleased to join the Advisory Board of GoodFi, a non-profit organization whose mission includes onboarding 100 million new users to DeFi by 2025. In addition, the Acala team [received its fifth Web3 Foundation Grant for xTokens](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/acala-team-receives-fifth-web3-foundation-grant-for-xtokens-providing-cross-chain-messaging-for-8bade7c8f98f), and announced a new [initiative with RMRK](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/karura-x-rmrk-de-fi-meets-nf-ts-16860) to tokenize DeFi incentives and add gamification to Karura’s DeFi protocols.

Read on for more details from our May 2021 report.

## **Acala Joins GoodFi Advisory Board** <a href="#b7eb" id="b7eb"></a>

Acala is thrilled to join the Advisory Board of [GoodFi](https://www.goodfi.com/about), a non-profit organization founded to make decentralized finance as easy as possible.

## Acala Team Receives Fifth Web3 Foundation Grant for xTokens <a href="#275d" id="275d"></a>

The Acala team has received its [fifth Web3 Foundation Grant for xTokens](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/acala-team-receives-fifth-web3-foundation-grant-for-xtokens-providing-cross-chain-messaging-for-8bade7c8f98f), providing open source cross-chain messaging for all Polkadot and Kusama parachains. The xTokens grant follows the team’s previously awarded grants for the aUSD stablecoin, Acala EVM, LaminarChain, and Reusable Libraries. With the xTokens implementation in place, Acala has enabled a cross-chain ecosystem in which fungible assets can be transferred from parachain to parachain, and between relay chain and parachain, bringing us one step to achieving composability between all chains on Polkadot and Kusama.

## Karura collaborates with RMRK <a href="#ad83" id="ad83"></a>

Karura and RMRK have [announced a collaboration](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/karura-x-rmrk-de-fi-meets-nf-ts-16860) to combine DeFi applications on Karura with NFT features on [Kanaria](https://url.rmrk.app/acala), a fundraiser for the RMRK Association, which distributes unique NFT eggs that will hatch into rare Kanaria birds with upgradeable traits. The initiative extends Karura-bonuses to existing Kanaria bird owners, specifically anyone participating in Karura’s [crowdloan](https://acala.network/karura/join-karura).

## Karura Crowdloan Registration Now Open <a href="#72e2" id="72e2"></a>
