# Collator

## Overview

Collators maintain parachains by collecting parachain transactions from users and producing state transition proofs for Relay Chain validators. In other words, collators maintain parachains by aggregating parachain transactions into parachain block candidates and producing state transition proofs for validators based on those blocks. 

While Karuraâ€™s network security and consensus \(nPoS\) are provided by Kusama Relay chain's Validator set, the Collator set of Karura will keep the network alive by collecting parachain transactions for validators to verify them. Unlike validators, collators do not secure the network, a parachain only needs one honest collator to be censorship-resistant.

Karura's Collator node maintains a full-node service for the Kusama Realy Chain, and a full-node service for the Karura network. Each service has its own http/ws RPC endpoints, P2P ports etc. The base path of the Kusama full-node service is located inside of the base path of the Karura full-node service.

## Collator Roll Out Plan

Karura takes a phased approach to roll out the Collator operation. Since Collators are non-security critical operation, a parachain only needs one honest Collator to be censorship-resistant, and more collators are not necessarily good e.g. it will slow down the network, the Collator roll-out plan is designed first-and-foremost to ensure network stability and operation.

**Current Phase: Private Collator Set** 

**Phase 0: Private Collator Set**   
The Genesis of the Karura network was launched on 23rd June, 2021. Upon genesis, Karura's network security and consensus is provided by Kusama Relay Chain's norminated Proof-of-Stake \(nPoS\) validators. Just like Statemine \(the common-good asset parachain on Kusama\), Karura's Collators initially will be run by the Acala Foundation, until the Collator software is stable and can be released to the wider community.

**Phase 1: Authorized Collator Set**  
Through governance approval, Karura will then open the Collator set to an authorized set of collators. While there are no block rewards nor additional incentives for these authorized collators, they are paid a reasonable rate for their node service provisioning by the Acala Foundation. 

These collators are known reputable node service providers who have proven track-record of service levels and demonstrated deep commitment to the network. It is expected that there will be much chaos and software upgrades during this phase still, and these collators are required to work closely with the core dev team to ensure network stability. 

It is expected that the Karura network will maintain such authorized Collator Set until the network is fully stablized, the collator staking module and the reward scheme is fully implemented and audited.

**Phase 2: Public Collator Set**  
Through governance approval, Karura will then enable permissionless election of Collators and enable collator rewards. Due to the fact that Collators are non-security critical, a parachain only needs a small set of Collators to ensure liveness and censorship-resistance, the reward scheme will reflect this accordingly. 

## Collator Node

### Spec Requirement

Same as [the Kusama validator node requirement](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/mirror-maintain-guides-how-to-validate-kusama/#requirements).

### Run Node

Refer to the [Full Node Guide](full-node.md).

### Collator Configuration

#### **Key Management**

Karura Collator needs Aura session key. RPC `author_rotateKeys` or `author_insertKey` can be used to update session key.

#### **Registration**

* Karura is currently using the `collectorSelection` pallet from Statemint to handle collator registration. During the authorized Collator set phase, the required candidacy bond will be an unattainably high value to prevent public registration.
* Authorized providers will need to submit the public key of the Aura session key for the collator.

#### CLI

* `--collator` for the parachain part
