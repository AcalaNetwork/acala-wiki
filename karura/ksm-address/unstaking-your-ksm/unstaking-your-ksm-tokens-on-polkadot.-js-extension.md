# Unstaking Your KSM Tokens on Polkadot.{js} Extension

You will need to unstake your KSM tokens prior to bonding them to the [crowdloan module](https://wiki.acala.network/karura/crowdloan). For recently unstaked KSM tokens, Kusama has a delayed exit period \(7 days\), which serves as cooldown. During this period, you will not be able to transfer your tokens.

### Step 1: Stop nominating \(staking\) <a id="Step-1-Stop-nominating-staking"></a>

1.Open [Polkadot{.js}](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) and connect to the Kusama network. Then in the navigation bar at the top of the page, click on the “Network” dropdown and select “Staking.”

3. Click “Sign and Submit” in the bottom right corner to authorize the transaction. Your browser extension will prompt you to enter your password and sign the transaction. You have now stopped nominating, but your tokens remain bonded.

6. If done successfully, there should be a clock icon next the amount you requested to be unbonded. You can hover over the icon to see how much longer until the tokens are fully unlocked, which is approximately 7 days.

7. Once the 7 days have passed, you’ll have to issue another final transaction, “Withdraw Unbonded”. Once that is done, your tokens are transferrable.
