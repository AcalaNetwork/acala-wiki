# Unstaking Your KSM

In preparation of the Karura [crowdloan event](https://wiki.acala.network/karura/crowdloan), supporters who are currently staking \(bonding\) their KSM will need to unstake prior to bonding their KSM to the crowdloan module. For recently unstaked KSM tokens, Kusama has a delayed exit period \(7 days\), which serves as cooldown.
