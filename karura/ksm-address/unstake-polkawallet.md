# Unstaking Your KSM Tokens on Polkawallet

You will need to unstake your KSM tokens prior to bonding them to the crowdloan module. For recently unstaked KSM tokens, Kusama has a delayed exit period \(7 days\), which serves as cooldown. During this period, you will not be able to transfer your tokens.  


1\) Open the Polkawallet mobile app and navigate to the "Staking" tab. Select "Adjust Bonded."
