# Oracles

The Acala Oracle powered by the [Open Oracle Gateway](../../../../general/basics/oracle/) is used to feed real-time market price information to the stablecoin protocol.&#x20;

* The Acala Oracle operates a network of oracle node operators, it aggregates a number of external price feeds and provides a medianized reference price
* The adding and removal of whitelisted operators is managed via governance
* All price feeds will be provided with Quality of Service - these transactions are prioritized and guaranteed to be included in a block
* All valid feeds will be refunded with the transaction fees incurred, essentially making oracle feeds FREE for providers while preventing spam and ensuring integrity.&#x20;
