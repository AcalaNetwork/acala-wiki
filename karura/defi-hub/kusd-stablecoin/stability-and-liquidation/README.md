# Stability & Liquidation

The kUSD is designed to peg to US Dollar at 1:1 ratio through automatic risk management mechanisms and on-chain governance. Behind the scene, the `cdp-engine` is the main module that manages all kUSD vaults, managing surplus and debts, assessing risks, handling liquidation etc to keep the stablecoin protocol solvent and kUSD pegged.
