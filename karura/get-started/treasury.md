## What is Karura Treasury

Karura Treasury experiments with similar concepts and mechanisms of the Acala Treasury. Watch [the Acala Treasury intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8g89OPFH8) to learn more.

The Karura Treasury is a reserve of digital tokens, native and foreign to the Acala ecosystem, governed by KAR holders and funded from Karuraâ€™s protocol fees and community contribution events with the purpose of enabling long-term network self-sustainability and growth.

Deployment of the Treasury is initiated via Karura Treasury Proposals \(KTP\) that could include, but are not limited to:

* Self-funding a parachain slots on Kusama
* Bootstrapping protocol liquidity \(e.g. provide LKSM, kUSD or DEX pair liquidity\)
* Platform and protocol operations and improvements
* Network security operations and enhancements
* Software and tool development
* Community, marketing, and event funding
* Any other future community Karura Treasury Proposals \(KTPs\)
