Karura is a "canary network" for Acala an early unaudited release of the code that is available first and holds real economic value. 

No promise, and expect chaos. 

## What does Karura offer?

Karura’s all-in-one DeFi hub of Kusama to give you a taste on the decentralized swap, borrow, lend, earn, and more – all with micro gas fees.

Founded by the Acala Foundation, Karura is a scalable, EVM-compatible network optimized for DeFi. The platform offers a suite of financial applications including: a trustless staking derivative \(liquid KSM\), a multi-collateralized stablecoin backed by cross-chain assets \(kUSD\), and an AMM DEX – all with micro gas fees that can be paid in any token.

For developers, Karura is a proving ground for protocol upgrades, experiment with new DeFi protocols, and on-chain governance.

## Why build on Kusama?

Kusama is Polkadot’s canary network – a multi-chain network for radical innovation. By launching on Kusama, Karura can push the limits of what’s possible, giving the Acala Foundation team a place to launch bold new financial innovations. Karura will access Kusama’s plug-and-play security while enjoying high-capacity processing speeds, micro-gas fees, and interoperability between multiple networks, all ultimately bridged to Polkadot.
