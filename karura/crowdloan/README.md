Karura serves as the sister network to Acala, and offers a suite of financial primitives, including: a trustless staking derivative \(liquid KSM - LKSM\), a multi-collateralized stablecoin backed by cross-chain assets \(kUSD\), and an AMM DEX â€“  all with micro gas fees that can be paid in any token. Karura is a blockchain platform custom-built for DeFi and powered by KAR.

## **2. Crowdloan Overview**

The crowdloan event is an important milestone for launching the Karura network. Read more on the Karura launch phases [here](https://www.notion.so/acala/dcabf9ba7c6246c69b913d5972503227?v=4121894373fd43d98ffcac260803928d).

### **2.1 Parachain Auction**

Kusama is a sharded, multi-chain network that allows blockchains to connect for interoperability, scalability, and plug-and-play network security. Kusama is the cousin network of Polkadot. To join Kusamaâ€™s network, all parachains must participate in and win a unpermissioned candle auction to secure a slot on the network. Parachains can choose to raise KSM in a variety of ways in order to participate in the auction.

### **2.2 Purpose of Karura Crowdloan**

Karura has chosen to host a Crowdloan to trustlessly crowdsource KSM, which will be used to participate in the Kusama parachain auction. These KSM will be bonded, or â€˜lockedâ€™, in the Kusama Relay Chain for the duration of Karuraâ€™s parachain lease.

**Crowdsourced Network Security**  
  
KSM holders lock their tokens on Kusama for a period of time \(48 weeks for the first parachain auction\) to help Karura lease a parachain slot and gain access to Kusamaâ€™s plug-and-play security. In return for KSM holdersâ€™ loan, KAR \(Karuraâ€™s native token\) will be distributed to participants.

**Community-backed Launch**

KSM tokens will be returned to holders following parachain lease, with a guarantee of receiving the KSM principal back. It can be seen as a community-backed launch for individuals looking to contribute to the evolution of Kusamaâ€™s network and parachains.

**Fair Network Bootstrapping**

The KAR distributed to participants will be vested over a period of time, but the full balance can be used to participate in governance and other activities besides transferring. This helps us to build a strong and well-intentioned community from the ground up.

## **4. Post-Crowdloan/Auction**

After Karura has won the parachain auction, it will launch network Genesis on Kusama. The KAR rewards will be distributed after the network is launched. For those who did not participate via the Karura website \(without agreeing to the T&C\), there will be a KAR claim process upon launch.

If Karura does not win the initial auction, it will continue to bid in the subsequent auctions. If Karura fails to win any auction for six weeks after the beginning of the crowdloan, then it will end the crowdloan and return all funds to holders.
