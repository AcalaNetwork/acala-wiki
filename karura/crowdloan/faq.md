## Top Questions

### Have all the tokens been distributed?

If you participated through our Karura website or through one of our mobile wallet partners, your tokens have been distributed. Users that participated through other means will need to go through the claims process.

### Do I need to claim my tokens?

Only users that participated through the website [https://polkadot.js.org/apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps) \(screenshot below\) need to go through the claims process. All other users will have their tokens automatically distributed to them. If enter your Kusama address on [https://karura.subscan.io/](https://karura.subscan.io/) and don't see your tokens, you probably need to go through the claims process.
