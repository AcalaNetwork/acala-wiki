## **How do I participate in the referral program?**

## **Can I refer to my own KSM address and still qualify for bonuses?**

Yes, you can utilize more than one KSM address to earn 10% bonus rewards in KAR as both the referrer and the referee.

Karura will be going for the maximum 48 week lease period. This is technically eight 6-week slots in total.

Yes, you will receive KAR tokens upon network launch of Karura, then ACA tokens will be distributed after the Acala network launch.

## **If I missed the waitlist, can I still participate in the crowdloan?**

You can absolutely still participate in the crowdloan. Not signing up for the waitlist only means that you won't get your own referral link. The referral codes give  both the person referring and the person being referred 5% bonus rewards. So you can still get a 5% bonus if you use someone else's referral code.
