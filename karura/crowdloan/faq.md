# FAQ

## Pre-Launch

### **Is community@acala.network a real/official email?**

Yes. Be sure to sign up to the newsletter and join the \#karura-crowdloan channel on our discord for updates on the crowdloan and parachain auction events.

### **I didn’t get an email but I’m subscribed to the newsletter!**

This specific email was only sent to waitlist registrants. We’ll be sure to send to any updates on the crowdloan and parachain auctions to the full subscriber list when we have more details.

### **Can I update my KSM address on the waitlist?**

Yes, waitlist registrants have until 2:30am UTC Friday to update their KSM addresses.  
To update your KSM address, visit the waitlist form provided to you in your email.  
  
Note: Only those who already registered will be able to update their KSM address. Any new registrations will not be valid.

### **Is it possible to still register to the waitlist?**

Only those who already registered will be able to update their KSM address. But be sure to sign up to the newsletter and join the \#karura-crowdloan channel on our discord for updates on the crowdloan and parachain auction events.

### **How do I create an eligible KSM address?**

To be eligible for the Karura crowdloan referral program, your KSM address:

1. Must be a Polkadot.js or Polkawallet address
2. Must be a Kusama address
3. Must not be a Ledger address
4. Must not be an exchange address

### **How do I participate in the referral program?**

Those who participated in our waitlist promotion will be able to share referral links once they receive them. If you participate in the crowdloan via a referral link, you will earn 5% bonus KAR on your contribution to the Karura crowdloan and the referrer will earn 5%.

### **Can I refer to my own KSM address and still qualify for bonuses?**

Yes, you can utilize more than one KSM address to earn 10% bonus rewards in KAR as both the referrer and the referee.

### **If I missed the waitlist, can I still participate in the crowdloan?**

You can absolutely still participate in the crowdloan. Not signing up for the waitlist only means that you won't get your own referral link. The referral codes give  both the person referring and the person being referred 5% bonus rewards. So you can still get a 5% bonus if you use someone else's referral code.

## **Important Dates / Times**

### **When does the Karura crowdloan and Kusama parachain auction begin?**

### **When should I withdraw my KSM from my exchange?** 

We can assure you that both the Polkawallet mobile app and the Polkadot{.js} browser extension are compatible with the Karura crowdloan module.

### When should I unstake my KSM tokens for the crowdloan and parachain slot auction?

Because unbonding requires 7 days, many users are beginning that process to ensure that they are prepared for the event.

### How do I unbond my KSM?

We've created guides for unbonding your KSM in Polkadot{.js} and Polkawallet. Look here for more information:

Your exchange may also support the Karura Crowdloan, but you will need to contact them to learn more. We aren’t responsible for how users participate through exchanges.

### **How do I create a Kusama wallet?**

By creating a wallet through the Polkawallet mobile app or the Polkadot{.js} browser extension. Guides to setting up these wallets can be found [here](https://wiki.acala.network/karura/ksm-address/create-new-ksm-account).

You can find your Kusama address by referring to our guide found [here](https://wiki.acala.network/karura/ksm-address/check-ksm-addr).

### **Is there a step-by-step guide on how to participate in the Karura crowdloan?**

Not yet. Details for the crowdloan are still being finalized. We’ll include guides on how to participate in our knowledge base once all crowdloan and auction details have been finalized.

### **What is the minimum amount I can contribute?** 

Users must bond at least 0.1 KSM to the crowdloan module.

### **How long will my tokens be locked if I participate in the crowdloan?**

Your KSM tokens will be locked for the full duration of Karura’s parachain lease, which is 48 weeks.

### **Will my KSM be returned after the parachain lease ends?**

Yes, your KSM tokens will be automatically returned to you when the parachain lease ends.

### **How do I know for sure that my KSM will be returned to me at the end of the parachain lease?**

Karura never has custody of your KSM tokens. Your KSM tokens are bonded to the crowdloan module, which lives on the Kusama Relay Chain, and remain visible within your wallet.

### **How can I withdraw my KSM from the crowdloan?**

All submissions to the crowdloan module are final and cannot be withdrawn. You will automatically receive your funds at the end of the parachain lease.

### **Will I get my KSM tokens back if Karura doesn’t win the auction?**

If Karura does not win the initial auction, it will continue to bid in the subsequent auctions. If Karura fails to win any auction for six weeks after the beginning of the crowdloan, then it will end the crowdloan and return all funds to holders.

### **Can I earn KSM staking rewards while my KSM are locked?**

No. There are no staking rewards for bonding to the crowdloan module. However, if Karura wins, users receive KAR tokens.

## KAR Tokens

### **How many KAR tokens will I receive for participating in the crowdloan?**

Karura will distribute KAR tokens to crowdloan supporters at a ratio of at least 12 KAR for every 1 KSM. This could increase from 12 based on levels of participation.

### **What is the KAR token supply?**

There are 100,000,000 KAR tokens.

### **How many KAR tokens will be distributed in the crowdloan?**

11 million KAR tokens, which is equivalent to 11% of the token supply, will be distributed to contributors of the crowdloan module.

### Is there a vesting period on KAR tokens?

Yes. Upon receipt of your KAR tokens, 30% will be unlocked and transferrable, while the remaining 70% will be vested and gradually unlocked over the lease period. However, the full balance can be used to participate in governance.

### Where can I buy KAR tokens?

No exchanges currently list KAR tokens. However, you can receive KAR tokens by contributing KSM to the crowdloan module in the Karura Parachain Auction.

### What is the price of the KAR token?

The price will be decided by the open market after the Karura launch.

### **Will I receive KAR tokens for participating in the testnet?** 

No. You will only receive KAR tokens if you bond your KSM tokens to the crowdloan module in the Karura Parachain Auction.

## **Accessing Your KAR Tokens**

### **Is KAR a stablecoin?**

No. The Karura Dollar \(kUSD\) is a stablecoin. KAR is the native token of the Karura network.

### **When will I receive my KAR tokens from the crowdloan?**

Tokens will be distributed after the Karura network goes live.

### **Where will I receive my KAR tokens from the crowdloan?**

After Karura has won the parachain auction, it will launch network Genesis on Kusama. The KAR rewards will be distributed after the network is launched. For those who did not participate via the Karura website \(without agreeing to the T&C\), there will be a KAR claim process upon launch. Learn more on Karura launch process [here](https://www.notion.so/acala/dcabf9ba7c6246c69b913d5972503227?v=4121894373fd43d98ffcac260803928d).

### **How can I access my KAR tokens?**

After Karura launches, tokens will be distributed to users that bonded their KSM tokens to the crowdloan module. Users using the Polkadot.{js} extension wallet can access their KAR tokens by toggling the network to “allow use on any chain.” Similarly, Polkawallet users can access their KAR tokens by toggling the network to Karura. Learn more on Karura launch process [here](https://www.notion.so/acala/dcabf9ba7c6246c69b913d5972503227?v=4121894373fd43d98ffcac260803928d).

### **Why am I unable to transfer all of my KAR tokens right after the distribution?**

Only 30% of your KAR reward tokens will be available immediately after distribution. The remaining 70% will vest gradually during the parachain lease period \(e.g. each new generated block will unlock part of tokens\).

### **If I participated in the Build Acala event, do I first receive the Karura tokens then ACA?**

Yes, you will receive KAR tokens upon network launch of Karura, then ACA tokens will be distributed after the Acala network launch.
