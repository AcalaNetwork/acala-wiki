However, you can still use another person’s referral code to receive a 5% bonus, you just won’t be able to use that code to refer other people.

### Am I allowed to contribute to the crowdloan multiple times?

Yes. As long as the auction has not expired, you are allowed to contribute.

### **How does the referral bonus work?**

* If you're using someone else's link, you get a 5% KAR bonus on the amount **you** contributed
* If someone is using your link, you will receive a 5% KAR bonus on the amount **they** contributed

For example, if Alice shares her referral link with Bob, and Bob contributes 10 KSM to the crowdloan module, both will receive 6 KAR as a bonus \(10 KSM x 12KAR:1KSM reward ratio x 5%\).

### Which platforms support the Referral program?

* Karura official website
* Polkawallet
* Fearless Wallet
* Other platforms may also support them in a variety of ways. You can ask those platforms for details

Your KSM tokens will be locked for the full duration of Karura’s parachain lease, which is 48 weeks since the launch of the Karura network.

### **Will my KSM be returned after the parachain lease ends?**

Yes, your KSM tokens will be automatically returned to you when the parachain lease ends.

Karura never has custody of your KSM tokens. Your KSM tokens are bonded to the crowdloan module, which lives on the Kusama Relay Chain, and remain visible within your wallet.

### **Can I withdraw my KSM from the crowdloan?**

All submissions to the crowdloan module are final and cannot be withdrawn. You will automatically receive your funds at the end of the parachain lease.

### **Will I get my KSM tokens back if Karura doesn’t win the auction?**

If Karura does not win the initial auction, it will continue to bid in the subsequent auctions. If Karura fails to win any auction for six weeks after the beginning of the crowdloan, then it will end the crowdloan and return all funds to holders.

### **Can I earn KSM staking rewards while my KSM are locked?**

No. KSM contributed to the crowdloan are locked on the Kusama Relay Chain. You will however receive KAR tokens based on your contribution, once Karura wins the auction and launches mainnet.

## KAR Tokens

### **How many KAR tokens will I receive for participating in the crowdloan?**

Karura will distribute KAR tokens to crowdloan supporters at a ratio of at least 12 KAR for every 1 KSM.

### **What is the purpose of the KAR token?**

Yes. Upon receipt of your KAR tokens, 30% will be unlocked and transferrable, while the remaining 70% will be vested and gradually unlocked over the lease period. However, the full balance can be used to participate in governance.
