# Karura Launch Phases

Karura network has a phased launch plan. Keep up-to-date with the roll-out plan by viewing this [live roadmap](https://aca.la/karura-roadmap). _**Expect chaos & unannounced changes**_ 🔥

**Current Phase: Technical Verification & Runtime Upgrade**

## 🚀 \(Done\) Karura Genesis - Launch

The Genesis block of the Karura network was launched on 23rd June, 2021, as a Proof of Authority network. Governance was restricted to a single super-user \(sudo\) key, which is held by the Acala Foundation to issue transactions and upgrades to resolve issues and completes the launch process. 

Since genesis, Karura's network security is provided by Kusama's Nominated Proof of Stake \(NPoS\) Validators upon launch. Karura's Collators will be provided by node service partners at this stage.

**Karura parachain is available on** [**Subscan**](https://karura.subscan.io/) **&** [**Polkadot App**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkarura.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/explorer)\*\*\*\*
