2. Ensure you have a Ledger Acala account and a Ledger Polkadot Account imported into your Polkadot Js. _If you don’t have one, click the + button on the top right corner followed by “attach ledger account”_

6. Go to the your portfolio page and click transfer on the asset you wish to transfer. Click the drop down menu and select your Polkadot Generic account as the receiver. _If the account doesn’t show up as an option, it is likely due to the account not being connected to the platform (step 4)._
