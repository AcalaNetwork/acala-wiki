# Unstaking Your DOT Tokens on Polkawallet

You will need to unstake your DOT tokens prior to contributing to the crowdloan module. For recently unstaked DOT tokens, Polkadot has a delayed exit period (28 days), which serves as a cooldown. After the 28 day period has ended, you can claim your DOT and contribute them to the Acala crowdloan.

Unstaking on Polkawallet involves a few steps. First, you need to stop nominating to your Validator. Next, you need to unbond your tokens. Finally, after the "cool down" period finishes (7 days for Kusama, 28 days for Polkadot) you need to redeem (claim) your unbonded tokens.

## Stopping Your Nomination to Your Validator
