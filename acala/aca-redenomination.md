# ACA Redenomination

Acala chain is not live, so ACA redenomination does NOT have any impact on anyone, therefore this is for your information only.

### Key Points for the Redenomination

* The total fixed supply of \(old\) ACA in the [whitepaper](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala-white-paper/blob/master/Acala_Token_Economy_Paper.pdf) is 100,000,000. 
* After 10x redenomination, the total fixed supply of \(new\) ACA will increase 10 times to 1,000,000,000. 
* ACA balances will increase by a factor of 10. 
* The distribution of ACA does not change, and holders of ACA still own an equal share of the network as before the change.
* As an example, if an account has 1,000,000 \(old\) ACA that is 1% of the total supply, then after redenomination, the account would still have 1% of the total supply which is 10,000,000 \(new\) ACA.
* The main benefit of this change similar to the [DOT redenomation](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/redenomination) is to avoid using small decimals when dealing with ACA and make calculations easier.
* The main benefit of doing this before mainnet is that redenomination is way simpler before the Acala chain is live, with lesser confusion and no impact to users and service providers like exchanges and wallets etc.
