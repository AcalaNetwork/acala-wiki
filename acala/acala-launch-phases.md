# Acala Launch Phases

Acala network has a phased launch plan. Keep up-to-date with the roll-out plan by viewing this [live roadmap](https://aca.la/acala-roadmap).

**Current Phase: Technical Verification & Runtime Upgrade**

## üöÄ (WIP) Acala Genesis - Launch

The Genesis block of the Acala network will be launched on 18th December, 2021, as a Proof of Authority network. Governance was restricted to a single super-user (sudo) key, which is held by the Acala Foundation to issue transactions and upgrades to resolve issues and completes the launch process.&#x20;

Since genesis, Acala's network security is provided by Polkadot's Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) Validators upon launch. Acala's Collators will be provided by node service partners at this stage.

**Acala parachain is available on **[**Subscan**](https://acala.subscan.io)** & **[**Polkadot App**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Facala.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/explorer)**.**
