# Acala Launch Phases

Acala network has a phased launch plan. Keep up-to-date with the roll-out plan by viewing this [live roadmap](https://aca.la/acala-roadmap).

**Current Phase: Win Acala Parachain Slot Auction - Acala Genesis Launch**

## 🚀 (WIP) Acala Genesis - Launch

The Genesis block of the Acala network will be launched on 18th December, 2021, as a Proof of Authority network. Governance was restricted to a single super-user (sudo) key, which is held by the Acala Foundation to issue transactions and upgrades to resolve issues and completes the launch process.&#x20;

Since genesis, Acala's network security is provided by Polkadot's Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) Validators upon launch. Acala's Collators will be provided by node service partners at this stage.

**Acala parachain is available on **[**Subscan**](https://acala.subscan.io)** & **[**Polkadot App**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Facala-rpc-0.aca-api.network#/explorer)**.**

## ✋ Council Governance + Democracy

After the chain has been running stably with the collator set, the sudo key will perform a runtime upgrade and enable appointed Councilors and democracy. Other councils including Financial Council, Technical Council, and Liquid Staking Council, as well as public referenda will also be enabled. &#x20;

## 🗳️ Enable Democracy

Once the chain has been running well under Elected Council, it will propose to enable democracy - public referenda.

Enable public referenda so that anyone can propose a referendum by depositing the minimum amount of tokens for a certain period.&#x20;

## 💥 Remove Sudo

Sudo module will be removed via a runtime upgrade, and the Acala network will be governed by on-chain governance and token holders hereafter.&#x20;
