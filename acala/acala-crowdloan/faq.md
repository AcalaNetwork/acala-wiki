# FAQ

## Most Asked Questions

### Is the reward ratio the same across contribution methods?

Yes. The base ACA reward is the same regardless of how you participate.

### What is the minimum amount I can contribute? 

The minimum contribution depends on how you participate: 

**Liquid Crowdloan Contribution: **1 DOT 

**Direct Polkadot Contribution: **5 DOT 

**Partner Wallets: **5 DOT 

**Exchange:** Check with your exchange’s requirements

### How long will my DOT be locked? 

Your DOT will be locked for the full duration of Acala's parachain lease, which is two years. However, contributors have the option to participate through Liquid Crowdloan which gives them access the liquidity in their DOT contribution shortly after Acala’s launch. 

### When will I receive my ACA tokens? 

You will receive your ACA after Acala wins a parachain slot, launches the network, and enables token transfers.

### What wallets can I use to participate? Can I use Ledger? 

A list of supported wallets can be found here \[Link]. Ledger does not support Crowdloans in Polkadot.

### What if Acala doesn’t win the first parachain auction, what happens to my DOT? 

If Acala does not win the initial auction, it will continue to bid in the subsequent auctions. There are 5 auctions total in the first batch of parachain slots. 

### Do I need to sign up for the waitlist in order to participate? 

No. Signing up for the waitlist has no impact on your ability to participate. However, participating in the waitlist can entitle you for additional bonuses.

### Can I still sign up for the waitlist?

No. Signup for the waitlist has ended. However, you don't need to sign up for the waitlist to contribute to the crowdloan. Additionally, you can make a contribution to the crowdloan and receive a referral code from Acala. You can use this referral code to refer other users and receive ACA bonuses.

### How do I get a referral code? 

There are two ways to get a referral code. The first is by signing up for the Acala waitlist. If the deadline to sign up for the waitlist has passed or you are not on the waitlist, you can make a contribution to the crowdloan and receive a referral code from Acala. You can use this referral code to refer other users and receive ACA bonuses.

## How to Participate

### Can I participate in the Crowdloan through an exchange? 

Perhaps. Contact your exchange to learn if they are supporting the Polkadot parachain auctions. 

### I'm currently staking my DOT - what do I need to do? 

If you are staking on an exchange, contact your exchange to learn if they are supporting the Polkadot parachain auctions and for instructions on how to participate. If you stake directly in Polkadot, you must go through the 28 day unbonding period before you can make your Crowdloan contribution. Learn how to unstake your DOT [here](https://wiki.acala.network/acala/acala-crowdloan/dot-address/unstaking-your-dot).

### Will my DOT be returned after the parachain lease ends? 

Liquid Crowdloan Contributors can redeem any lcDOT they hold at lease expiration for the equivalent amount of DOT (the ratio of lcDOT to DOT is 1:1). All other contributors will have their full DOT contribution returned to them at lease expiration.

### What is the total ACA token supply? 

The total ACA supply is 1 billion ACA.

### How does the referral bonus work? 

**If you have your own referral code:** Enter YOUR referral code to self-refer when you make YOUR crowdloan contribution to receive a 10% bonus in ACA (5% as referrer and 5% as referee) on YOUR DOT contribution. Share YOUR referral code with others and receive a 5% bonus in ACA on THEIR DOT contributions. 

**If you don’t have your own referral code:** Enter SOMEONE ELSE’S referral code when you make YOUR crowdloan contribution to receive a 5% bonus in ACA on YOUR DOT contribution. Use the referral code ACALA GAVE YOU after you made your DOT contribution. Share it with others to receive 5% bonus in ACA on THEIR DOT contributions.

### Can I participate using Ledger? 

No. Ledger does not support Polkadot crowdloans. 

### How does Liquid Crowdloan Contribution work? 

Select the Liquid Crowdloan option when making your contribution on the Acala website or Polkawallet. After the Acala network launches, you will receive your ACA rewards plus lcDOT. lcDOT will be issued on a 1:1 basis against your DOT contribution and can be redeemed for DOT on a 1:1 basis at parachain lease expiration. lcDOT allows you to access the liquidity in your crowdloan contribution because lcDOT can be used in Acala’s DeFi primitives (e.g., trade, transfer, collateralize). lcDOT is also redeemable for DOT on a 1:1 basis at the end of Acala's parachain lease.

It's important to note that the Liquid Crowdloan option is not completely trustless like a Direct Polkadot Contribution. Instead, the Liquid Crowdloan option requires the contributor to trust Acala before becoming trustless.

### What is lcDOT? 

Liquid Crowdloan DOT (lcDOT) represents the underlying DOT liquidity of an Acala Crowdloan DOT contribution. When a participant contributes DOT via the Liquid Crowdloan option, they will receive lcDOT, a liquid (unlocked) token available for use on Acala’s DeFi hub in addition to ACA rewards. lcDOT can be used to swap, collateralize for a self-serviced loan in aUSD stablecoin, and more. lcDOT is redeemable for DOT on a 1:1 basis at the end of Acala’s parachain lease.

### If I sell my lcDOT, will I still be able to receive my DOT contribution at the end of the parachain lease? 

Contributors that made a Liquid Crowdloan Contribution must hold lcDOT at the end of the parachain lease in order to redeem their lcDOT for DOT. If these contributors no longer hold lcDOT, they won’t be able to redeem for DOT.

### If I sell my lcDOT, can I still receive ACA rewards?

Yes. If you make a DOT contribution to the Acala Crowdloan, you will receive ACA rewards. Selling your lcDOT has no impact on your ACA rewards.

### Does lcDOT vest?

No. Your lcDOT will be distributed with your ACA rewards after the Acala network launches and transfers are enabled. However, a portion of your ACA rewards will vest over the duration of the Acala parachain lease.

### Can I make a Liquid Crowdloan Contribution and a Direct Crowdloan Contribution from the same address? 

Yes. 

### Can I withdraw my DOT from the crowdloan? 

No. All submissions to the crowdloan module are final and cannot be withdrawn. 

## ACA Tokens 

### Who receives ACA tokens? 

Anyone that makes a DOT contribution to the Acala crowdloan will receive ACA tokens. 

### What is the purpose of the ACA token? 

ACA is the utility token that powers the DeFi hub of Polkadot. ACA is used for: 

**Transaction Fees** 

**Proof-of-liveness** (incentives for running Acala nodes) 

**Foundation of governance** (upgrading the network, adjusting Risk Parameters, etc)
