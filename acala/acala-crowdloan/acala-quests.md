## About Acala Quests 

The purpose of Quests is to educate users about Acala and prepare them for the Acala Crowdloan. As an incentive, users that complete ALL of the Quests will receive an extra 2% ACA bonus on their Acala contribution, an Acala NFT and their own referral code which entitles them to an additional 5% ACA bonus on referee contributions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to complete the Quests in order to participate in the crowdloan? 

No. However, there are several reasons why we encourage users to complete the Quests: 

**For users on the Acala Crowdloan Waitlist:** Completing Quests 1 and 2 is the ONLY way to get your referral code. If you complete Quests 1 and 2 before the Acala Crowdloan launches, your referral code will be emailed to you once the Acala Crowdloan launches. If you complete Quests 1 and 2 after the Acala Crowdloan launches, your referral code will be emailed to you. Having your own referral code prior to when you contribute is the only way you can self-refer and receive a 10% bonus. 

**For users not on the Acala Crowdloan Waitlist:** Completing Quest 4 allows you to receive your own referral code which can get you an extra 5% ACA bonus on contributions made by contributors that use your code. 

**For ALL users:** Completing ALL of the Quests entitles you to an extra 2% ACA bonus on your contribution and an Acala NFT. Quests are also a way to educate yourself about Acala and prepare yourself for the Acala Crowdloan.

### How long will Quests run for?

Quests will run for the duration of the Acala Crowdloan.

### Do I need to make my crowdloan contribution with the same account I completed the Quests with to receive my 2% bonus and NFT? 

Yes.

### Can I use a Ledger wallet to complete the Quests? 

No. Ledger does not support Acala at all, even if you connect your Ledger to the polkadot.js extension.
