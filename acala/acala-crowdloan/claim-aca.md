# Claim ACA

**Most crowdloan contributors do not need to claim their ACA or lcDOT tokens. They will be automatically distributed to you.** However, if you participated in the Acala crowdloan through the https://polkadot.js.org/apps/ website, you will need to read and agree to our Terms and Conditions in order to claim your tokens.

If you are unsure, you can also check to see if you need to go through the claims process by going to our [distribution website](https://distribution.acala.network). Once you enter your address, if your status is `To Be Claimed`, then you need to go through the claims process.

## Option 1: Using Polkadot{js} Browser Extension

Navigate to the [claims website](https://distribution.acala.network/claim/acala). Connect your Polkadot{js} Extension, **using the same account that participated in the crowdloan event**, and follow the prompts to complete the process.

Youâ€™ll be required to use the extension to sign a message, but it does not cost any transaction fees. Once the process is completed, it may take up to 48 hours for distribution to be scheduled.
