## 4. Check Rewards

Rewards to be distributed are all recorded on the [Distribution Website](https://distribution.acala.network).

**All ACA rewards have been distributed (except for the ones that say `to be claimed` ).** There are several ways to check your balances:

### Checking on Polkadot.js.org

Go to your Polkadot.js **extension** and make sure it is set to `allow use on any chain`.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Allow use on any chain.png>)

Go to [Polkadot JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) and connect to the Acala network. You can do this by clicking on the dropdown box in the upper left hand corner (shown below).

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Toggle for Acala.png>)

Select an Acala node (any is fine) and click `Switch`.

Select `Accounts`. You should see your ACA amount. Note that some of your balance will be locked. This amount will unlock over the 96 week parachain lease.
