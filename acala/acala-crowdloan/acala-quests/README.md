## About Acala Quests 

The purpose of [Acala Quests](https://acala.network/acala/quests) is to educate users about Acala and prepare them for the Acala Crowdloan. As an incentive, users that complete ALL of the Quests will receive an extra 2% ACA bonus on their Acala contribution, an Acala NFT and their own referral code which entitles them to an additional 5% ACA bonus on referee contributions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to complete the Acala Quests in order to participate in the crowdloan? 

No. However, there are several reasons why we encourage users to complete the [Acala Quests](https://acala.network/acala/quests): 

**For users on the Acala Crowdloan Waitlist:** Completing Quests 1 and 2 is the ONLY way to get your referral code. If you complete Quests 1 and 2 before the Acala Crowdloan launches, your referral code will be emailed to you once the Acala Crowdloan launches. If you complete Quests 1 and 2 after the Acala Crowdloan launches, your referral code will be emailed to you. Having your own referral code prior to when you contribute is the only way you can self-refer and receive a 10% bonus. 

**For users not on the Acala Crowdloan Waitlist:** Completing Quest 4 allows you to receive your own referral code which can get you an extra 5% ACA bonus on contributions made by contributors that use your code. 

**For ALL users:** Completing ALL of the Quests entitles you to an extra 2% ACA bonus on your contribution and an Acala NFT. Quests are also a way to educate yourself about Acala and prepare yourself for the Acala Crowdloan.
