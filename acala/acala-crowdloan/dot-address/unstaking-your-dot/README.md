# Unstaking Your DOT

In preparation for the Acala crowdloan event, supporters who are currently staking (bonding) their DOT will need to unstake prior to contributing their DOT to the crowdloan module. For recently unstaked DOT tokens, Polkadot has a delayed exit period (28 days), which serves as a cooldown. After the 28 day period has ended, you can claim your DOT and contribute them to the Acala crowdloan.

The following guides are available to help you through the process:
