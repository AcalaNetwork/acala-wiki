# Creating a New DOT Account

While there are several wallets that support Kusama, **we've found that the Polkadot.{js} browser extension best serves most desktop users and the Polkawallet mobile app best serves most mobile users. Follow the guides below based on your wallet preference.**

## Option 1: Creating a wallet through Polkadot{.js} browser extension

1\) Go [here](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) to download the browser plugin. The browser plugin is available for both Google Chrome (and Chromium based browsers like Brave) and FireFox.

This browser extension does one thing: it manages accounts and allows the signing of transactions with those accounts. It does not perform wallet functions, like sending or receiving, or show you wallet balances. After setting up your Polkadot.js browser plugin, you can use the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/) website to check balances, transfer DOT, and more. Once you install the Browser plugin, be sure to pin it to your toolbar:

2\) Open the Polkadot{.js} browser extension by clicking the logo on the top bar of your browser. You will see a browser popup not unlike the one below. Click the big plus button or select `Create new account` from the small plus icon in the top right. The Polkadot{.js} plugin will then use system randomness to make a new seed for you and display it to you in the form of twelve words.

3\) You should back up these words as explained here on the [Polkadot wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-account-generation). It is imperative to store the seed somewhere safe, secret, and secure. If you cannot access your account via Polkadot.js for some reason, you can re-enter your seed through the `Add account menu` by selecting `Import account from pre-existing seed.`

4\) Name your account and choose a password. The password will be used to encrypt this account's information. You will need to re-enter it when using the account for any kind of outgoing transaction or when using it to sign a message. Click `Next step.`

**Note that this password does NOT protect your seed phrase. If someone knows the twelve words in your mnemonic seed, they still have control over your account even if they do not know the password.**

**Do not ever share your seed phrase or password.**

Keep "Network" as "Allow use on any chain." Click the `account with the generated seed.`

5\) You’ve successfully created an account. To see your Polkadot address, you can change the visual display of how your address appears. Click on the gear icon in the upper right corner. Under the dropdown menu for “DISPLAY ADDRESS FORMAT FOR,” select `Polkadot Relay Chain.`
