# Overview

Acala takes a phased approach to employ various governance mechanisms that will allow it to progressively decentralize and ultimately be commanded by the majority network stakeholders. Acala's governance framework is based on Polkadot's technology that employs a Referenda chamber, a General Council, and a Technical Committee to govern the network.

Acala however has sub councils that manage specialized aspects of the network including the Financial Council and the Liquid Staking Council.&#x20;

## Referenda

Referenda is a simple, inclusive, stake-based voting scheme. Referenda can be started by public proposals or council proposals. There is a 8-day enactment delay associated with it. Emergency proposals (e.g. fix urgent network issues) can be "fast-tracked" to have a shorter enactment period.&#x20;

Karura experiments with Polkadot's voting mechanisms including Tallying, Voluntary Locking, Adaptive Quorum Biasing. Read more [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance/#referenda).&#x20;
