# Claiming Vested ACA

**Even though tokens may be vested (unlocked), you will still need to claim them before you can transfer them or use them in DeFi applications on the Acala platform.** You can learn how to claim your tokens by following the guide below:

1\) Go to your Polkadot.js **extension** and make sure it is set to `allow use on any chain`.

2\) Go to [Polkadot JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) and connect to the Acala network. You can do this by clicking on the dropdown box in the upper left hand corner (shown below).

5\) Go to the `Developer` tab and click `Extrinsics`. Select the account with the vested ACA. In the `submit the following extrinsic` dropdown, select `vesting` and `claim()`. Then, click `Submit Transaction`.
