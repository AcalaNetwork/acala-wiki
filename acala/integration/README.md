# Integration Guide

Acala is a parachain of the Polkadot Relay chain, with all of its network security and consensus provided by Polkadot's Validator set. As a [Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/)-based chain, most of Acala's integration points are the same as Kusama and Polkadot. As a parachain specifically though, the key differences will be outlined in this document.

This guide contains the following sections:

1. [Protocol Info](protocol-info.md)
2. [Token Transfer](token-transfer.md)
3. [Acala Network](networks.md)
4. [Run a Full Node](full-node.md)
5. [Run a Collator Node](collator.md)
6. [Parachain Integration](../../integrate/composable-chains/README.md)
