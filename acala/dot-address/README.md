# DOT Address

To participate in Acala crowdloan, you must have a DOT address used to contribute DOT to the Acala crowdloan. This DOT address also has a corresponding Acala \(ACA\) address, that shares the same public-private-keypair, which will be used to receive your ACA rewards.

If you already set up an Acala account following [this guide](https://wiki.acala.network/learn/get-started#create-a-polkadot-account), then you can check its corresponding DOT address for use in the crowdloan.

The guide below shows you how to check the corresponding address for DOT and ACA, how to create a new DOT address if you don't already have one. Note: you should NOT use an exchange address for the crowdloan.

## Overview

Once you have created an account \(a public-private-keypair\) in Polkadot{js} extension, that account can then derive a bunch of addresses, one for each Substrate-based chain e.g. the same account can have an address for Polkadot, a different one for Kusama, another different one for Acala. But they all share the same private key and public key. As an analogy, they share the same username and password, but the account display name are different for different blockchains you interact with.

1. If you already have a Substrate address \(Polkadot address, Acala address or other\), we will [show you how to check the corresponding DOT address](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/acala-wiki/tree/a904000f53ce0c0a2413ce7d81777459735b673f/acala/dot-address/check-DOT-addr.md) and vice-versa.
2. If you don't have any account set up, we will show you how to [create a DOT account](create-new-dot-account.md), which can also be used for Polkadot, Acala and else.
