# Check DOT Address

If you already set up a Polkadot account, Acala account, or any Substrate-based chain account, there are two options to check the corresponding DOT address:

* you can use [Subscan Address Transform](https://acala-testnet.subscan.io/tools/ss58_transform);
* setting your wallets in polkadot.js extension 
* use PolkaWallet mobile app

## Using Subscan transform

1. Navigate to [Subscan Address Transform](https://acala-testnet.subscan.io/tools/ss58_transform) and paste your existing account address into "Input Account or Public Key".
