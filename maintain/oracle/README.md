# Open Oracle Gateway

## Overview

The challenge of providing reliable, accurate and decentralized oracles cannot be solved by Acala alone. When taking into account that Acala is the DeFi hub and platform powering more cross-chain DeFi DApps on Polkadot, Kusama and beyond, creating a more open, inclusive, and decentralized oracle infrastructure with other leading projects in the industry becomes critical. The Open Oracle Gateway \(OOG\) is a significant step towards that vision. 

The Gateway allows multiple oracles to be deployed on the Acala network, leveraging Acala's DeFi optimized oracle infrastructure, and serving any DApps on Acala, Polkadot, Kusama and beyond.  Specifically, the Gateway offers:

1. **Multiple Oracle Networks**: multiple parties in addition to Acala Oracle can operate their own oracle services. Providers can set up their own oracle network with node operators, or integrate with an oracle API. 
2. **Price Feeds by Choice**: Dapps can choose to use an aggregated feed from all providers or a single provider, or they can obtain raw data from individual node operators and aggregate them themselves. 
3. **Quality of Service**: All price feeds posted through the Gateway will be provided with Quality of Service - these transactions are _operational transactions_ \(system critical transactions\) that are prioritized and guaranteed to be included in a block.
4. **FREE of Fees**: All valid feeds will be refunded with the transaction fees incurred, essentially making oracle feeds FREE for providers while preventing spam and ensuring integrity. 
5. **Progressive Decentralization**: Acala network will progressively decentralize, start with PoA \(appointed Council governance\), then evolve into elected Council governance and eventually democracy. The Gateway then initially will require sitting Council approval for accepting new oracle providers and their node operators. 

## Next Step

Going forward, we may set up a separate Oracle Council to make on-chain decisions on Providers and their Operator membership and other related affairs. With customizable chain logic and economic policies on the Acala chain, the design space for oracle economic models and on-chain payment mechanisms is huge and we are only scratching the surface.
