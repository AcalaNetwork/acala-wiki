# Proof-of-Liveness \(PoL\) Node \(Coming Soon\)

### Proof-of-Liveness \(PoL\) Node \(Coming Soon\)

While the Acala Network will leverage Polkadotâ€™s shared security and do not need dedicated validators itself, it will still require what we call Proof-of-Liveness \(PoL\) nodes to maintain the operation of the Acala network to perform part or all of the following actions

1. As Collator to propose new blocks to validators for verification
2. As Network Operator to perform off-chain work such as liquidating unsafe positions
3. Optionally as Oracle Operator

For Karura Network and Acala Mainnet, there will be incentives for becoming a PoL node. There is reward for running PoL node as a Collator and Network Operator, and additional reward for also running as Oracle Operator.

The initial period of Karura and Acala network will be PoA, and gradually upgraded to be permission-less network. Oracle Operation will remain PoA until we have definitively secure decentralized solutions.

If you are interest in becoming a collator/liveness provider for the Acala Network, and joining the wider Acala ecosystem, please [fill in this form](https://forms.gle/WQesfKVZmJeXov1e9).
