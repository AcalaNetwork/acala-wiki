# How to run a standard RPC archive node

Running an archive node is usefull if you want query the blockchain on your local network, most likely because you're developing a dApp that needs to have unlimited requests, to constantly parse the blockchain or to get all the history of blocks to make statistics. For example to build a bridge or an arbitrage bot.

```text
docker run -d --restart=always -p 30333:30333 -p 9933:9933 -p 9944:9944 \
  -v /root/acala-node:/acala/data acala/karura-node:latest \
  --chain karura --execution=wasm  --pruning=archive
```

#### For Acala \(Coming Soon\)

```text
docker run -d --restart=always -p 30333:30333 -p 9933:9933 -p 9944:9944 \
  -v /root/acala-node:/acala/data acala/acala-node:latest \
  --chain acala --execution=wasm  --pruning=archive
```

You can look at those flags in detail in the [Node Command Line Argument page](node-cli.md)
